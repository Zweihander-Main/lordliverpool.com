“Pitt is to Addington, As London is to Paddington” quipped the mean Canning, but that was unfair. Addington (1757-1844) was a better financier than Pitt, getting the wartime budget close to balance in 1803-04 through applying withholding to the new income tax. His Peace of Amiens of 1802-03 was only a temporary truce, during which Addington achieved a notable election victory, but that was Napoleon’s fault not his. He brought together most of the ministerial team that was eventually to end the war successfully. Addington was generally a good administrator; his one major mistake was to appoint to the Admiralty Earl St. Vincent (1735-1823), a naval hero but a poor administrator and an unpleasant personality with the usual Whig taste for nepotism and jobbery. Later, as Viscount Sidmouth, Addington was a notably successful Home Secretary and a valued member of Liverpool’s Cabinet.

Like the other prime ministers Pitt through Liverpool, Addington held office in an exceptionally difficult period; in contrast to the Victorians, who mostly had it very easy. He thus deserves to rank above the middle of the pack, somewhere in the 20s.
