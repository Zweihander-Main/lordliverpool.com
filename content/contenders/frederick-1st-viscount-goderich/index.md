Goderich (1782-1859) had proved his cowardice by trying to resign from the Exchequer in December 1826, when he realized his preceding over-populist Budgets had left the fisc in a precarious position (in the event Liverpool’s stroke and Canning’s succession allowed him to retreat to the Lords and the war ministry). Then Canning’s death over-promoted him. He resigned office before the 1828 Session met, after a quarrel between his two leading economic ministers, William Huskisson (1770-1830) and John Herries (1778-1855). The equivocally triumphant Battle of Navarino does not justify his six months in power; he should be ranked at the bottom, with only the damaging 20th Century failures below him.
