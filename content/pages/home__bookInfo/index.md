Britain’s Greatest Prime Minister: Lord Liverpool unpicks two centuries
of Whig history to redeem Lord Liverpool (1770-1828) from ‘arch-mediocrity’
and establish him as the greatest political leader the country has ever seen.

In the past, biographers of Lord Liverpool have not sufficiently acknowledged
the importance of his foremost skill: economic policy (including fiscal,
monetary and banking system questions). Here, Hutchinson’s decades of
experience in the finance sector provide a more specialised perspective on
Liverpool’s economic legacy than most historians are able to offer.

From his adept handling of unparalleled economic and social difficulties,
to his strategic defeat of Napoleon and unprecedented approach to the
subsequent peace process, Liverpool is shown to have set Britain’s course for
prosperity and effective government for the following century. In addition
to granting him his rightful place among British Prime Ministers on both
domestic and foreign policy grounds, Hutchinson advances how a proper
regard for Liverpool’s career might have changed the structure and policies of
today’s government for the better.
