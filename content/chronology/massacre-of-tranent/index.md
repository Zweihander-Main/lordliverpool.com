    Following the 1797 Militia Act, which authorized the recruiting of 6,000
    militia in Scotland, a recruiting squad of about 80 soldiers under Major
    Wight, which included a party of the Cinque Ports light cavalry under Captain
    Finlay, was attacked with rocks, bottles etc. in Tranent by an organized mob
    of protesters against Army recruiting activities.


    After several attempts to quell the rioters, Major Wight ordered the dragoons to fire, killing some of the rioters but dispelling them, after which the soldiers appear to have lost discipline and killed various innocent people in the surrounding countryside, to a total of 11 dead and 8 injured. Liverpool, the Cinque Ports light cavalry’s commanding officer, was not present, being at the county town of Haddington about 10 miles away. The facts of the case were laid before the Lord Advocate of Scotland, but no action was taken.


    The “massacre” as it can correctly be called with respect to the non-rioters, who appear to have represented 7 of the 11 killed, has recently been played up locally, with a rather ugly monument to the rioters erected in 1995. Liverpool’s collateral involvement has of course fuelled nationalist and leftist agendas. The accusation that he should have been present at Tranent makes little sense since only a small part of his regiment was involved, and Major Wight, not of his regiment, was the senior officer present. Liverpool can however be considerably criticized for the poor discipline of his men and for the failure of Captain Finlay to keep them under control.
